                      <strong>Ritwik Pandey,</strong> An Agriculture Specialist who has done his graduation from Amity University, Noida always had a heart for it. To have started really young, Ritwik’s mother was a Botany Professsor, that was when he gave undivided attention to the scoped world into Agriculture and plants.
Being a young entrepreneur, Ritwik always had dreams which was not just a castle in the air.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Been brought up in a small town from Madhya Pardesh, Jabalpur, Ritwik grew up seeing the farmers and the villages around.
Since then, he knew where he had to be. When Ritwik was 21 years old, he went for a field trip in a town near. Where not only did he see the plight of the farmers but when he interacted with them, he tells us “They had no money for the machinery, no scope for labour. The input cost was so high that the daily earning could not do it.” Ritwik further adds, “There was zero access to advanced technology for machinery and labour also” .The farmers told him “Sab mehenga hain! Muh maanga rate dena pad raha hai, Jitna kamate hain, sab chala jata hai. Kya bachaye, Kya khaayein”<br/><br/>
The field trips explained him that not only were the farmers troubled but the machinery was not received on time, even when the payment was just in time. The farmers had to go through the struggle of caste barriers and other social Barriers which could not be avoided, as they came from such places.<br/>
It’s not a cliché situation, when Ritwik thought it’s time to decipher the issue and bring a smile on these faces which had nothing but guilt and were unassisted. While studying agriculture and going for field trips, Ritwik recognised that the machinery that was provided to the farmers was not advanced and they were paying blindfold for that. The input cost that he could evaluate was more that what the farmers were earning on a circadian substructure. <br/>
Evaluating the scenario, he came up to a point where he realised that the profit for the farmers was not incrementing and neither was the yield. There was no assistance for the farmers and no expert handles were provided.

                    </p>
                    <div id="demo1" class="collapse">
                    <p>
                      This was the time Ritwik came up with a fine solution of the model he and his teams have engendered which would not only resolve the plight but additionally come up with reducing the emotional and additionally the financial dilemma of the farmers!

                    </p>

                    <p>
                      2016 is the year when Ritwik started working towards establishing Aadishakti.
While he was working towards crystallizing Aadishakti, He met Harkunwar Singh Sethi who is also the Director of Aadishakti. Harkunwar is an alumnus from XLRI, Jamshedpur and an expert in the field of business management who just did not have the management skills but also had a near corder for the farmers. Having known Harkunwar for years, It was time the two minds met and the plight to fluctuate!
Singh began with a seed commitment towards Aadishakti usineg all management and strategy skills and he is the business brain behind it!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Aadishakti has come ahead with solutions to the farmers and their worry. It’s a just in time change for the country. Time to build, educate and enlighten them.
Both the young geniuses did not just have the potential but had a determination to do the best for the down and out!

                          There was a time when the student essays commenced with "Madhya Pradesh, Land of farmers", the scenario is not only tightening but transmuting the durability for the farmers additionally. Three-fourth of the population here is dependent on agriculture or agro cognate activities for its livelihood and it is this uniformity that keeps society threaded together. But that initial line will certainly not be a true representation of the state’s status in the present condition.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Today agriculture is no more a simple denotes of livelihood anymore, but has become a task full of challenge and jeopardy. A survey by the National Sample Survey Organisation on the indebtedness of farmers shows that of the 64 lac farmers in Madhya Pradesh, 32 lacs are beholden. On an average each farmer in M.P. is under a debt of Rs.14,128. And because of the bank formalities and the inhuman instauration processes his confide in the government’s financial institutions has gone down. It is worth noting that even today 40 % of the imprests in this ‘agricultural state’ are taken by farmers from non-governmental sources.
